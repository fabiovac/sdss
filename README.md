# SDSS - Seats distancing software support

### Historical background

During the Covid-19 pandemic period social distancing became a necessity. People have to keep a security distance from each other to avoid any possible virus transmission. There was initially a very heated debate regarding the right distance to ensure security. After a while, maybe for practical neces- sities, security distance was set to one meter. Restaurants and any public place where tables and seats are present have to respect those security pre- cautions: seats and tables too close to each other should be disabled and as a consequence commercial establishmentsâ€™ capacity drastically decreased.

In such a situation became clear the need for a software to support restaurant owners with some kind of software to exploit their space in the best possible way. For this reason I thought that a software to help to find the best configuration of seats and tables in a room, with the goal of maximizing the number of people in that space, was a good software product.
